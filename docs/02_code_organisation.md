# Code Organisation, Dep0 and DepC

The source tree is organised as follows:
* `antlr4/` contains lexer and parser grammars and
  the ANTLR4 jar used during compilation to generate
  the C++ code that does the parsing of `.depc` source file.
* `dep0/` is the bootstrapping compiler written in C++20 or later.
  It is my desire to one day reach self-hosting,
  i.e. write a DepC compiler in DepC.
  That day a new `depc/` folder will contain its source code.
  Inside `dep0/` the code is organised in numbered folders,
  so that lexicographical and dependency order match.
  In particular:
  * `app/dep0` contains the `main.cpp` of the final `dep0` compiler,
    which assembles the pipeline stages in `lib/`
    together with the LLVM machinery.
  * `lib/00_antlr/` contains the CMake targets to generate
    the C++ parser from the ANTLR4 grammars mentioned earlier.
  * `lib/00_core/` contains general purpose core functionality,
    like mmap-ing a source file, error handling, etc.
  * `lib/01_ast/` contains the generic (i.e. templated)
    Abstract Syntax Tree and some functions that operate on it,
    eg beta-reduction or renaming; more details can be found in
    [03 - Dep0: AST, Pipeline and Performance](03_dep0.md).
  * `lib/02_parser/` contains the entry point of
    the parsing stage of the compiler pipeline.
  * `lib/03_typecheck/` contains the entry point
    of the typechecking stage.
  * `lib/04_transform/` contains the entry point of
    the transformation stage along with some transformations
    that can be applied on a legal AST,
    i.e. an AST that typechecks correctly.
  * `lib/05_llvmgen/` contains the entry point of
    the LLVM IR code-gen stage.
  * `lib/99_testing/` contains general purpose testing facilities,
    among all
    [custom Boost.Testing predicates](https://beta.boost.org/doc/libs/1_82_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/testing_tools/custom_predicates.html)
    for the templated AST.
* `testfiles/` contains source code in DepC used for
  testing the compiler, currently `dep0` but one day `depc` too.
  Within it, tests are organised in numbered sections,
  so that, if people are working on different features at the same time,
  they can each reserve a section for their feature
  and put the test files within that, so to minimise PR conflicts.
  Within each numbered section test files can be named
  pretty much at will but, unless there is a strong reason to diverge,
  the recommended approach is to have numbered test files,
  per category, among:
  * `pass` meaning that this code should compile successfully;
  * `parser_error` meaning that the compiler is supposed to
    detect a parsing error;
    please add a comment to highlight where the error is;
  * `typecheck_error` meaning that the compiler should detect
    a typechecking error;
    again, please add a comment to highlight where the error is.
  
  For instance `0000_basics/pass_000.depc` or `0006_kinds/parser_error_002.depc`.
* `tools/` contains a potentially assorted array of tools;
  currently only `devbox`, which is a docker image with
  the toolchain for, hopefully, reproducible builds.
